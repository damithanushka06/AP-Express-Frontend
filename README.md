# AP-Express-Front-End
The front-end of our AP automation software is developed using Angular, a popular open-source framework for building web applications. The primary goal of the front-end is to provide a user-friendly interface for the users to interact with the software.

The front-end is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy maintenance and scalability. The modules are organized based on the different functionalities of the software, such as user management, approval groups, bills, purchase orders, payment, etc.

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a focus on providing a seamless user experience. The layout and design of the interface are also customizable to fit the branding and preferences of each organization.

To ensure the security of the software, we have implemented Spring Security with JWT token-based authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the system and perform the required actions.

In terms of performance, the front-end is optimized for speed and reliability, with minimal loading times and minimal downtime. We have also incorporated features such as caching and lazy loading to improve the overall user experience.

Overall, the front-end of our AP automation software is designed to provide a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience for our clients, enabling them to manage their accounts payable processes efficiently and effectively.
